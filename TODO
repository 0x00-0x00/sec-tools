# TODO

## High level
* Only testing installs ATM. Not running them.
* Test single installations to hunt ninja dependencies
* stuff that uses wine doesn't actually install
* Add uninstall + warning if already installed
* add check into sec-tools to not multiple add CTF_ROOT and PATH 

## More than maybe
* add HashPump, angr, Python_Pin, taintgrid
* add villoc, valgrind, volatility, yafu 
* add wireshark, sublime text, pwntools, sonicvisualizer 
* add pngtools, exiftool, fsck

## Maybe?
* add virtualenv + rbenv for things
* install qemu bins to $CTF_ROOT/bin

## Things that are failing/broken
* stegdetect install is broken
