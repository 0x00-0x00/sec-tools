# TODO

## High level
* Maybe put *_anal into just tools.
* Make a sweet README.md
* add installing package-name:i386
* Test every package with manage-tools.sh
* rename dirs into how the tool is usually called, e.g. "hash-identifier" to "hash_id". 

## Maybe? 
* Go through hacked team
* add virtualenv set up to the manage-tools setup
* maybe link popper util bins to /bin

## More than maybe
* add HashPump
* add Python_Pin
* add taintgrind
* add IDA free
* put r2 bins into /bin

## Things that are failing/broken
* qemu install fails
* PadBuster is broken
* add pathgrind to /bin
* stegdetect install fails
